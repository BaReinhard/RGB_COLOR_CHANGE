# RGB_COLOR_CHANGE
RGB Color Change Examples For Multiple Platforms in Multiple Languages

#Arduino
In the Arduino Folder, several sketches can be found to programmatically control a RGB LED, to navigate the visible spectrum of colors, from Red -> Yellow -> Green -> Teal -> Blue -> Magenta -> Red

#Raspberry Pi
In the Raspberry Pi Folder, several different files can be found to programmatically control a RGB LED, to navigate the visible spectrum of colors, from Red -> Yellow -> Green -> Teal -> Blue -> Magenta -> Red. This folder includes files using low level c (writing to registers) all the way to higher level python using pre-existing libraries.

#C.H.I.P. (COMING SOON)
In the C.H.I.P. Folder , several different files can be found to programmatically control a RGB LED, to navigate the visible spectrum of colors, from Red -> Yellow -> Green -> Teal -> Blue -> Magenta -> Red.
